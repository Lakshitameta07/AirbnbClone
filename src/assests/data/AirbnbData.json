Airtel network was available only at a few places but the property has got Wi-fi so we were connected while on the property. The room is spacious, can easily accommodate 4 people and was neat and clean with an attached bathroom. It also had a small kitchenette with a water filter and utensils. The room has an open area in front which has a great view and also a small garden on the side which our puppy absolutely loved. There is a short trek down from the farm to a river nearby but it was just a trickle when we visited yet the riverside was super quiet and comforting. <br/>The food is cooked by a family that travels from Udaipur when guests arrive and can cook whatever you ask them to besides the menu as well. Food was spicy and a little expensive but that is also because the cook has to travel and carry the supplies from far. <br/>It is better to call the host for directions and not solely depend on the location as it is not exactly on the main road. <br/>Overall a refreshing 2 night stay, and best part being they welcome pets! :) :)",

However we will put sign-boards to give guest confidence that they are on right track.  \r<br/>2) Food is outsourced to caretakers and we are still contemplating if we shud keep fixed menu or labour charges plus cost of materials, we also give customers option to bring their own groceries and  just provide caretakers as assistants. Getting materials remotely is always challenging for smaller homestays.  But we did learn from your stay and next two customer enjoyed fully.  \r<br/>3) The car can come upto the cottage on the hill and we are also having a senior citizen staying with us today. I wil certainly take feedback from them too.\r<br/>We look forward to your stay with us again so that you can see what all we have improved.",

We don't offer Luxury but Warmth & Comfort; offering simple food and an experience.\n\nPeople who loved staying here were Nature Lovers, Artists, Writers, Group of Friends who want to reunite and spend some time,  Families who want to expose their kids to nature and Farm life and Human Beings who want to spend time in the hills.\n\nThe Bungalow @The Riverside Estate is a two-step stone cottage with thick walls made by local artisans in a very traditional way. The Bungalow is on the top of a small hill easily accessible by car/two wheeler or by foot. The nearby area is full of vegetation and a river which flows 9 months in a year.\n***********************************************************************************\nThe Bungalow offers accomodation options as below:\n\n** Option 1:  One King-size double-bed Air Conditioned suite with an attached bathroom and a small kitchenette. The room has space to add two single beds and can comfortably take 4 adults.There is also a private open verandah attached to the Suite & a small garden with spectacular views of mountain and surroundings.  (YOU ARE CURRENTLY BOOKING THIS OPTION)\n\n** Option 2:  One Four Bed Family Room in a lower basement room with four single beds. Though it's in the lower basement, it's open from 3 sides and it's quite well ventilated. The room is air-cooled (not air-conditioned), thick stone walls and foliage around makes it very cosy during summers and at the same time it is pretty warm during winters all thanks to the local architecture.

    "about": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI came to Udaipur back in the 1970s and fell for the beauty of the Venice of the East - with its lakes, mountains and people. Eventually, I decided to stay here and open up my place so that friends, family and enthusiasts could also soak in this beauty. \r\n\r\nThe natural beauty of the Aravallis and the lakes drew me here and I came with my books and all that I needed to live with. I love reading and some of my favourite authors include Somerset Maughan and Robbert Goddard, and my interest meanders towards biographies. \r\n\r\nI'd love to see you here and it will be nice to chat over everything and anything as the sun sets over the mountains behind. See you soon!",

The cottage is immaculately done with a great sitout, a gazebo, a plunge pool, 3 excellent bedrooms rooms, bathrooms with a marble bathtub and shower, and a private garden. Two rooms have private balconies with views of the City Palace and the Monsoon Palace. You can gaze over the fields and the forests of Udaipur to the palaces. It is the perfect place to spend a few nights.\n\nNestled in the Aravalli hills, my place is perfect for the great weekend away or for some much needed rest and relaxation during your great Indian adventure. Udaipur is a city of palaces and lakes and this is a luxurious cottage in this city - made just for modern Maharajas and Maharanis. The cottage opens out to views of lush green hills with a view stretching out over small farms to the palaces of Udaipur.\n\nEach room says its own story in terms of design style and the sheer comfort that it offers. The beds are all four-poster king sized beds with the spring mattresses on offer. The rooms have their own windows and opening out to the plunge pool in the cottage and the views beyond.\n\nEvery room comes with an attached bathroom - one made of marble and having the rare option of both a shower and a bathtub.\n\nThere are 2 rooms on the first floor and one on the ground floor. The rooms on the first floor open out to the landing area with its own small bookcase. The staircase would then lead you down  to the room on the ground floor and the great covered outdoor seating place. The room on the groundfloor is wheelchair friendly. The cottage then opens out to the cozy plunge pool.

We understand guest needs for space and quiet.\n\nIt's a rural community on the edge of two villages yet only 15 minutes drive from the city. Great walking and easy access by car or taxi to the delights of udaipur, shopping, sightseeing and restaurants.\n\n- Being in a village on the outskirts of Udaipur, there is little public transport. \n- Taxis can be arranged on prior request.\n\n- We have bicycles free of charge to roam around the village in and WiFi free in most areas. \n- Breakfast is complimentary.",

    "about": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI came to Udaipur back in the 1970s and fell for the beauty of the Venice of the East - with its lakes, mountains and people. Eventually, I decided to stay here and open up my place so that friends, family and enthusiasts could also soak in this beauty. \r\n\r\nThe natural beauty of the Aravallis and the lakes drew me here and I came with my books and all that I needed to live with. I love reading and some of my favourite authors include Somerset Maughan and Robbert Goddard, and my interest meanders towards biographies. \r\n\r\nI'd love to see you here and it will be nice to chat over everything and anything as the sun sets over the mountains behind. See you soon!",
